Ajsaja was invited to lead a two-day protein design workshop at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. He was joined by Federico and Eva as teaching assistants.

Participants were introduced to the fundamentals of protein design and gained hands-on experience with state-of-the-art tools such as AlphaFold2, RFdiffusion, and ProteinMPNN. During the workshop, attendees successfully designed de novo four-helical bundles.
