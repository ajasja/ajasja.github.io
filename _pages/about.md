# Welcome to the world of *de novo* designed proteins and molecular machines!

We design and study dynamic protein assemblies from scratch, with a strong focus on coiled-coil structures.

During my postdoc in the [Baker Lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/) I have designed and developed a *de novo* random walker, that uses coiled coils as feet. We are exploring future applications of this random walker scaffold to build useful protein robots. See the [CC-WALK](/research/Random-walker) project for more info.

My lab combines the power of the Rosetta software suite with cutting-edge deep learning tools (including AlphaFold2, RFdiffusion, and ProteinMPNN) to engineer novel proteins with high precision. This hybrid approach lets us harness the binding specificity and modularity of coiled coils, alongside the structural diversity and robustness of *de novo* protein scaffolds. 

To make these advanced design strategies accessible, we've developed and released [Prosculpt](https://github.com/ajasja/prosculpt), an open-source library for next-generation protein design.
