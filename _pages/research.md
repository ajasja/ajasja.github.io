## Molecular machines

We design protein-based molecular machines that mimic the function of nanoscale motors in nature. Our main focus is building programmable protein fibers and protein "walkers"â€”tiny machines that move along these tracks. This work lays the foundation for new types of synthetic, controllable systems at the molecular level.

## Design of Binders

We engineer custom proteins that bind tightly and specifically to natural targets, such as viral proteins, receptors, or enzymes.
