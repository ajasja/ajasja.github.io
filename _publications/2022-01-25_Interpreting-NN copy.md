Structurally complex and dynamic biomolecular assemblies are key components of lifelike systems and materials. State-of-the-art rules and guiding principles for the design of these peptide-, protein-, and polynucleotide-based nanostructures were discussed by a group of international leading scientists gathered at the virtual EMBO workshop.
