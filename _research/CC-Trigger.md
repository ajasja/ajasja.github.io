The aim of this research project is to implement toehold mediated strand displacement principle using coiled coils (CCs) strands and demonstrate several exciting applications that this new technology would enable, for control of enzyme activity and localisation, reconfigurable multistate protein assemblies and logic gates. CC strand displacement could have a huge impact on protein design and could generate a range of biomedical applications. DNA nanotechnology has already demonstrated that the strand displacement principle can be extremely powerful and versatile. We aim to bring the same versatility and programmability of applications to the more biocompatible and genetically encodable protein world.
