The vision for my research group is to design and study mechanic protein assemblies capable of **producing work** and make the first steps towards **designer nanorobots.**


I have made contributions in three main research fields.

**Biophysics and microscopy**: During my PhD I developed a method to obtain position specific diffusion coefficients from MD simulations that was used in structure determination of membrane peptides. I have also gained a strong interest in **fluorescent **microscopy****. Later I specialized in **fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and in single molecule microscopy**.

**Design of novel coiled coil structures:** I designed a platform **(CoCoPod) that enables design of arbitrary polyhedra, limited only by the number of orthogonal CCs. I have also extended the affinity and number of CC building blocks.

**De novo** **protein design**: I successfully won an MSCA fellowship that enabled me to work in the lab of David Baker at UW. I designed four helix bundles with buried hydrogen bond networks to use as feet for the random protein walker. I also contributed to COVID research and to the Rosetta modelling suite.

I also have experience with **Cryo-EM** and my students regularly use the in-house Cryo-EM microscope.
